1. The Breadth First Search is the best way to search through the graph as it makes sure to hit every node.
2. The Depth First Search is better because theres no way the program will get stuck in a maze.
3. We had trouble displaying the maze once the program was finished.
4. The breadth first search will not find the best path, it will find every path. It will return the paths that don't work as well.
